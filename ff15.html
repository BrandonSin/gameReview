				<h2>A Prophesied Masterpiece that Missed the Mark</h2>
				<p>Final Fantasy XV, the game that I have waited since the first trailer launch in 2006 had always been in my mind. The twisted theme of Romeo and Juliet, fast paced combat and dark atmosphere piqued my interest.
					I followed its development phases and every changes that were incorporated. The end result was a disappointment.</p><br>
					<p>The story itself changed entirely from what was known before. The Rome and Juliet-esque was replaced with the brotherhood theme. The game had extensive character development for all the essential party members but was cut short for story related villains and figures.
						Important characters like Princess Luna who was suppose to be the "Juliet" had her role cut short and virtually underplayed. 
						I was generally disappointed in the change of direction but if one was to go into game blindly without prior knowledge then I would say the story is quite good. </p><br>
					<p>Final Fantasy music has always been consistently breathtaking and XV did not deviate from that. Each piece crafted from Yoko Shimomura were enthralling and fit perfectly in the moment. Every track was prestigious
						and reflected clearly in the way the characters were experiencing at the time.
					</p><br>

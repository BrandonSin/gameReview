            	<h2>A Great Work That Set A New Benchmark For Adventure Games </h2>
				<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the first game that came out for the Nintendo Switch. It was a stunning start as the game gave the franchise a new direction. The Immensive map size and attention
                    to detail left players in awe as I can safely state, "what you see is where you can go". The game included every biome with realistic transitioning in between rendered the experience natural and whimsical. 
                </p><br>
					<p>The story was simple but pleasing to see how it unfolds. As an adventure/open world game I did not expect the story to be inspiring. The system of recollecting Link's memory incentivize the player to roam and search in the
                        grandeur kingdom of Hyrule. The only aspect I wish to see were the interactions between Zelda and Link. Although they were limited, it was the quality in those scenes that makes me beg for more. 
						I was generally disappointed in the change of direction but if one was to go into game blindly without prior knowledge then I would say the story is quite good. </p><br>
					<p>The scores in game were magnificent. It had its own crafted theme while there were hints of older unforgettable themes from the past. The ambient noise mixed with a few jumpy piano notes made the adventuring more lively.
                         There were times when music was barely played but it is understanble when the player is in the constant state of exploration.
